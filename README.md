Dive into my twist on the classic Snake game, made in Scratch! Here's what you can expect:

Simple Controls: Guide your snake with the arrow keys. Up, down, left, right â€“ it's easy to learn but tough to master.
Grow Your Snake: Each time your snake devours the food, it grows longer, adding a layer of challenge as you navigate through the play area.
Avoid Obstacles: The goal is simple - don't get eaten by the dog. 
Score High: Every piece of food gives you points. How high can you score before the dog gets you??
Retro Fun: Bringing back the nostalgia of old-school arcade games with a modern, colorful twist that's perfect for all ages.

This project showcases basic game mechanics like movement, growth, collision detection and scoring all implemented in Scratchs friendly block-based coding environment. 

Whether you're here to play or to peek behind the curtains at the scripts, there's something for everyone. Enjoy the simplicity, challenge yourself!
